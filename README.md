# Bird Take Home Assignment

Things to improve:

- Concurrency: Handling unauthenticated and permissionless state better when requesting location updates.
- Tests: I didn't have enough time to add tests but I have implemented everything keeping testability in mind so it should be easy enough to setup mocks with a tool like sourcery.
- Location Permissions: Give the user more flexibility in when we ask for location permission so they can show their own prompt before asking for permissions.
